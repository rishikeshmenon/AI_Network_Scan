### üß† How It Works

1. **Download Training Images** using keyword-based web scraping.
2. **Train a Classifier** with [ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI) and a ResNet model.
3. **Extract & Filter URLs** network scan and filter results.
4. **Take Screenshots** of target URLs with Pyppeteer.
5. **Classify Images** with the trained model.
6. **Retrain** with improved data iteratively.
